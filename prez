Parallellism-

2017 pgday - Parallel query with postgresql

This feature is still being developed, and new capabilities will be added in the next releases. Nevertheless, the current implementation 
is already rather useful, 
Good thing is we don't have to change the query. Upgrade your instance and we can exploit this capability 
You will never get CPU faster.. Only way is to break tasks into smaller tasks for go faster - Mechansim to make Postgres faster - 
Parallel queries, sharding 
Matrix on the capability 9.6 
===========================
Postgres 10 some things more than Postgres 6

Sequentail scan - read the data sequentailly from beginning to end. These can be done in parallel from 9.6. Four process to read 25% of data
each 
B-Tree Index - 
Bitmap index scan - alternate way of B-tree index. 
Hash join - to join two tables..one of te techniqueues used for join. for bigger tables 
nestd loop join - one loop in another loop
Aggregation - is a common operation.. select count(*), average is a way of aggregation.. 
Gether Merge - 
PL - SQL is a declarative language.. ask questions and don't expect answers as we expect 
Proceduraal language - go to that file, open it , do process 
Pl/pgSQL - better parallel queries in v10

Gather - parallel to non-parallel - for ouput. 
parallel query only has 1 gather node
My suggestion -
=============
pgbench - scale factor - 50 ... 
too much parallelsim is also not good - too much I/O and memory consumption
play with these factors
